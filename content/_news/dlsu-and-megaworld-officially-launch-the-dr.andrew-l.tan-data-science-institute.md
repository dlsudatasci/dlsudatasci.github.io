DLSU launches Dr. Andrew L. Tan Data Science Institute

De La Salle University, in partnership with the Megaworld Corporation, officially launched the establishment of the Dr. Andrew L. Tan Data Science Institute (ALTDSI) last July 21 in a virtual ceremony. The Institute is named after innovator and brand builder, Megaworld’s CEO and Chairman Dr. Andrew L. Tan.

The ALTDSI aims to create new knowledge out of the abundant data available and to train the next generation workforce of data scientists, particularly professionals in the BPO industry. The ALTDSI will capitalize on the state-of-the-art facilities donated by Megaworld Corporation, while DLSU faculty-researchers and visiting professors will sustain ALTDSI research-based graduate programs, undergraduate programs, and training and professional courses.

“Data science and data analytics have helped people in business processes and interpret insights to pursue innovations. There is a huge demand for knowledge outsource professionals who can help businesses and industries grow exponentially. This partnership with DLSU to build the ALTDSI is just the first step in tapping into this huge potential,” said Megaworld's Chief Strategy Officer, Mr. Kevin Tan.

The ALTDSI will be situated in McKinley Hill Cyberpark in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig.

Aside from the signed MOA, there was an exchange of glass plaques between DLSU President Br. Raymundo Suplido FSC and Megaworld Corporation’s Chairman and CEO Dr. Andrew Tan to formalize the partnership.

The event was witnessed by members of the DLSU Board of Trustees, administrators, guests from Megaworld Corporation, and DLSU personalities who had vital roles in sealing the initiative.
