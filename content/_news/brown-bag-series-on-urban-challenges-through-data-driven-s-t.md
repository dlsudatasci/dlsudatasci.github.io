Data science and its applications can bring many benefits to the management of large urban environments and have the potential to inform both policy and administration of public services. However, the rapid increase in data generation capabilities, which leads to the so-called “big data”, has driven the research community to develop new means to efficiently collect, store, and connect data for making informed decisions. In this talk, I will present our recent efforts in tackling urban challenges at various stages of the analytic pipeline by leveraging novel engineering and big data techniques. Particularly, I will showcase our work through three real-world applications: (1) a “zero-cost” cloud-based solution for managing epidemic data; (2) assessing COVID-19’s effects on food access in NYC using mobility data; and (3) a data-driven dashboard for flood simulation, visualization, and decision support. I will also discuss our vision of the next-generation visual analytic applications, and how they can work together with data science to improve the societal impact

**About the speaker:**

Huy Vo is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at The City College of New York (CUNY-CCNY), and the Center for Urban Science and Progress at New York University (NYU-CUSP). His research focuses on large-scale data analysis and visualization, big data systems, and scalable displays. He received his B.S. in Computer Science (2005) and PhD in Computing (2011) from the University of Utah, where his thesis was supported by two NVIDIA Fellowship awards (in 2009-2010 and in 2010-2011). He currently directs the Big Data Interactions Lab that works closely with domain scientists, city agencies and urban planners to investigate novel techniques of big data and its applications in the urban domain.
