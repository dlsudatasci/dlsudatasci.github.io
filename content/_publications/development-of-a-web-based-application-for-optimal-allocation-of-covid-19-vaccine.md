abstract: 'The COVID-19 pandemic posed a huge impact to the global economy and on
  the environment. Recent developments in battling the pandemic include the availability
  of vaccines for public use. The distribution of vaccines requires systematic planning
  as supplies to a given region can be limited. Process integration techniques such
  as mathematical programming can be applied to develop solutions for systematic planning
  of COVID-19 vaccine distribution. To enable the use of mathematical programs for
  policymakers, a graphical user interface is needed. In this study, a web-based application
  (app) for allocating vaccines is presented, utilizing non-linear programs to optimally
  distribute vaccines to different population groups. Two models are incorporated
  in the app: (1) a model that minimizes the number of vaccines required to slow down
  the spread of the disease, i.e., reduce the reproductive number to less than one
  and (2) a model that determines the optimal allocation at the minimum reproductive
  number. The optimization models for the app were written in Python using the Pyomo
  package while the graphical user interface is written in JavaScript with the use
  of the React library. The optimization models are accessed through an API served
  using a Python web server utilizing the web framework Flask. A case study is used
  to illustrate how the models work in the web application.'
