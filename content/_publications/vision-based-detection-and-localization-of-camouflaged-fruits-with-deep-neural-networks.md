abstract: In agriculture, camouflage, i.e. fruits are occluded due to high color similarity
  to its environment, is one of the problems of fruit detection and counting for yield
  estimation. In this paper, we developed a system that automatically detects and
  counts fruits from images in an unstructured environment with heavy occlusion and
  high color similarity. We built two datasets by capturing the natural settings of
  the fruit and fine-tuned various deep convolutional neural networks with region
  proposal network for a very challenging task of detecting heavily occluded fruits
  with high color similarity against the background. The evaluation results show an
  average precision of 0.922 for chili pepper dataset and 0.966 for bell pepper dataset.
  The result of this network can be integrated into an application for efficient management
  of agricultural farms, thereby contributing to precision agriculture.
