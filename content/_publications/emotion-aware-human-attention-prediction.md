  Despite the recent success in face recognition and object
  classification, in the field of human gaze prediction,
  computer models are still struggling to accurately mimic
  human attention. One main reason is that visual attention
  is a complex human behavior influenced by multiple factors,
  ranging from low-level features (e.g., color, contrast)
  to high-level human perception (e.g., objects interactions,
  object sentiment), making it difficult to model computationally.
  In this work, we investigate the relation between object
  sentiment and human attention. We first introduce an
  improved evaluation metric (AttI) for measuring human attention
  that focuses on human fixation consensus. A series
  of empirical data analyses with AttI indicate that emotionevoking
  objects receive attention favor, especially when they
  co-occur with emotionally-neutral objects, and this favor
  varies with different image complexity. Based on the empirical
  analyses, we design a deep neural network for human
  attention prediction which allows the attention bias on
  emotion-evoking objects to be encoded in its feature space.
  Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior
  performance, especially on metrics that evaluate relative
  importance of salient regions. This research provides
  the clearest picture to date on how object sentiments influence
  human attention, and it makes one of the first attempts
  to model this phenomenon computationally.
