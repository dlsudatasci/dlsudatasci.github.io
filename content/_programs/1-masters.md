### Program of Study

The Data Science graduate program has six (6) core courses and students are able to customize their learning experience through four (4) electives. The courses are scheduled across three terms for full-time students and five terms for part-time students. The remaining terms are for the thesis development.

The core courses are as follows:

- Principles of Data Science
- Data Visualization
- Data Governance, Ethics and Privacy
- Machine Learning for Data Science
- Big Data and Scalable Computing
- Research Methods

### Admission Requirements

To be eligible for consideration to the MS in Data Science program, you must hold a Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution, which includes a minimum of four years of full-time study. Please be advised that admission to a program that is different from your undergraduate field of study may require the completion of prerequisite courses before you will be permitted to begin graduate-level coursework. Due to the technical nature of the program, students will be expected to have a strong technical background, typically with an undergraduate degree in STEM.

All applicants to DLSU graduate programs must follow, without exception, the requirements, schedule and procedures set by the Office of the Admissions and Scholarships which can be found [here](https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/admissions/graduate/).

### Financial Aid

Students admitted to the program at DLSU will have the opportunity to apply for a limited number of tuition scholarships. All applicants will be evaluated on a competitive basis. The scholarships, if awarded, will assist in covering a portion of the tuition expenses for a maximum duration of two years.
