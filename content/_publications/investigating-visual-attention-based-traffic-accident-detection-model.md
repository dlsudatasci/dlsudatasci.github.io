abstract: "Spotting abnormal or anomalous events using street and road cameras relies
  heavily on human observers which are subject to fatigue, distractions, and simultaneous
  attention limit. There are several proposed anomalous event detection systems based
  on complex computer vision algorithms  and  deep  learning  architectures.  However,
  \ these  systems  are  objective-agnostic,  resulting in high false-negative cases
  in task-driven abnormal event detection. A straightforward solution  is  to  use
  \ visual  attention  models.  However,  these  are  based  on  low-level  features
  \ integrated  with  object  detectors  and  scene  context,  rather  than  on  the
  \ observers'  object  of  gaze. In this paper, we explore a task-driven visual attention-based
  traffic accident detection system. We first examine the human fixations in free-viewing
  and task-driven goals using our proposed, first task-driven, fixation dataset of
  traffic incidents from different road cameras called TaskFix. We then used TaskFix
  to fine-tune the visual attention model, in this work called TaskNet. We evaluated
  the proposed fine-tuned model with quantitative and qualitative tests and compared
  it with other visual attention prediction architectures. The results indicate the
  potential of the visual attention models in abnormal event detection. The dataset
  is available \nhere: https://bit.ly/TaskFixDataset"
