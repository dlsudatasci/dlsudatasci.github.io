page-description: The Data Science Institute research projects are inspired by the
  latest research methodologies and tools in data engineering, machine learning, analysis
  and prediction. We aim to discover new approaches to aggregating and analyzing data
  towards solving monumental problems in fields as diverse as business, education,
  public policy, health care and engineering. We serve as a core of data science research
  initiatives across DLSU that call for the cooperation of people from different disciplines,
  providing innovative, impactful and long lasting solutions towards a better quality
  of life. The priority research areas of the institute are (1) Sustainable Cities,
  (2) Climate Actions and (3) Computational Data Science.
