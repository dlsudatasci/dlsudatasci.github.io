Data scientists from the De La Salle University (DLSU) have used machine learning (ML) to analyze factors that affect student performance using data on reading results from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2018.

In the first year that the Philippines had participated in PISA, results showed that 15-year-old Filipino students ranked last in reading among 77 countries who joined the assessment.

The best models made through ML by the DLSU research team show an 81-percent accuracy in determining if a student profile can meet or may fall below the standard.
