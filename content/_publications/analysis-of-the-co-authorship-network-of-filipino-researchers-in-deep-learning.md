  The largest group of researchers come from De La Salle University (26.44%), comprised
  of engineering and computing researchers. The second largest group is from the University
  of the Philippines - Diliman with 15.71% of researchers. [Right] The top 10 cluster

abstract: Deep learning is an emerging field that attracts attention from various
  researchers to use in analyzing and understanding increasingly complex systems and
  phenomena. Crucial to the advancement of deep learning research in the Philippines,
  institutions need to understand its direction and reach out and work with other
  leading researchers who have knowledge, insight, and resources to contribute to
  the challenges in deep learning research. Due to its wide application, we analyzed
  the collaboration dynamics and patterns of Filipino researchers working in this
  field through their co-authorship network. Our study found that while there is a
  steady increase in research productivity on deep learning, most of the publications
  and collaborations are concentrated on a handful of institutions like De La Salle
  University and University of the Philippines Diliman. Despite their current control
  over the direction of the local research community, these two top institutions have
  yet to form strong collaborations. We also found that Filipino researchers are mostly
  doing applied deep learning projects and rely heavily on undergraduate students
  to maintain productivity.
