The MS In Data Science program takes up two years or more in completion. It has 36 academic units, broken down into 18 units of core courses, 12 units of elective courses and 6 units of thesis. The core courses are as follows:

* DATA200 Principles of Data Science
* DATA201 Data Visualization
* DATA202 Data Governance, Ethics and Privacy
* DATA203 Machine Learning for Data Science
* DATA204 Big Data and Scalable Computing
* DATA290 Research Methods

The program also allows the student to choose three different tracks. The tracks are as follows:

* Big Data Analytics Track
* Applied Machine Learning Track
* Business Analytics and Business Intelligence Track

The **Big Data Science** track focuses on honing the programming skills required for data engineers to extract, transform and load data from various sources to a unified and structured format for the data to be processed for analysis and machine learning later in the pipeline by the data scientists.

The **Applied Machine Learning** track will allow students to dive deeper into understanding the different machine learning techniques and methods appropriate for domain-specific data mining problems and use cases.

The **Business Analytics and Business Intelligence** track will focus both on technical knowledge and on various business applications to be able to properly communicate data solutions to the customers and to stakeholders.
