The Global Disinformation Index (GDI) is pleased to announce the publication of a new report that examines the risks of disinformation within the media market of the Philippines. This report is the outcome of research conducted by GDI in collaboration with the Dr. Andrew L. Tan Data Science Institute (ALTDSI) at De La Salle University. The research was carried out between July and November of 2022. 

In today's digital landscape, where traditional news, media, and communication systems are being disrupted, it is crucial for producers, funders, and readers to understand the risks associated with consuming and sharing disinformation. Disinformation has become a lucrative industry that thrives in our decentralized, multi-platform online environment. Effectively combating disinformation requires a comprehensive and unbiased understanding of the factors that contribute to its spread, as well as those that mitigate it. GDI's independent risk-rating framework empowers advertisers, tech companies, governments, and consumers to make well-informed decisions and prevent the real-world harms caused by disinformation.
