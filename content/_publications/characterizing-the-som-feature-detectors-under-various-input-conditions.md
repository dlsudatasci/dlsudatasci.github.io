abstract: "A classifier using self-organizing maps (SOM) as feature de-\ntectors is
  a more accurate representation of how the biological visual\nsystem works in terms
  of its learning mechanism. Each SOM feature de-\ntector is de\fned over a limited
  domain of viewing condition, such that\nits nodes instantiate the presence of an
  object. The weights of the SOM\nnodes are trained via competition, similar to the
  development of the vi-\nsual system. We argue that to approach human pattern recognition
  per-\nformance, we must look for a more accurate model of the visual system,\nnot
  only in terms of the architecture, but also on the way how the node\nconnections
  are developed, such as that of the SOM's feature detectors.\nThis work characterizes
  SOM as feature detectors to test the similarity of\nits response vis-\x13a-vis the
  response of the biological visual system, and to\nbenchmark its performance vis-\x13a-vis
  the performance of the traditional\nfeature detector convolution \flter. We use
  various input environments\ni.e. inputs with limited patterns, inputs with various
  input perturbation\nand inputs with complex objects, as test cases for evaluation."
