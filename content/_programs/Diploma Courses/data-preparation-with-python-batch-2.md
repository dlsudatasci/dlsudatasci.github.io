This 24-hour introductory course is designed to provide students with the basic Python concepts, techniques, and tools necessary for preparing any type of data for deeper and complex analysis. This course will explain the importance of exploring and preparing data prior to data analysis. Once data has been acquired, specific characteristics about the data have to be understood to appreciate the dataâ€™s complexity and perform an informed analysis later. At the end of the course, the student is expected to have a fundamental knowledge of how data can be collected and prepared using Python in order to be used to gain insights in real-world applications.

**Who is this course for?**

This course was designed for individuals who have no programming experience in Python or completely new to programming. It is recommended that this course be taken prior to the more advanced courses in data science offered such as Foundations of Data Science, Data Visualization, and Introduction to Machine Learning.

**How will the course be conducted?**

The course will be fully online and course materials will be delivered through our online learning management system, AnimoSpace. Asynchronous videos and activities are provided weekly for students to accomplish prior to the synchronous sessions held every Saturday 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM.
