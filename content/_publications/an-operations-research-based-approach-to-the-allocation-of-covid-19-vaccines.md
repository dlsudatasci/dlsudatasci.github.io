abstract: The global scientific community has been successful in their efforts to
  develop, test, and commercialize vaccines for COVID-19. However, the limited supply
  of these vaccines remains to be a widespread problem as different nations have started
  their respective vaccine rollouts. Policymakers continue to deal with the difficult
  task of determining how to allocate them. This research work will present how the
  use of mathematical models can provide valuable decision support under such conditions.
  Both a linear programming model and a nonlinear programming model have been developed
  to determine the optimal allocation of COVID-19 vaccines that minimize fatalities
  and COVID-19 transmission, respectively. These scenarios have to be dealt with when
  not enough vaccines are available, and the pandemic is still in progress. The model
  is capable of handling large scale allocation problems such as those intended for
  the general population of a country. It could also be scaled down for organizations
  such as private companies or universities. The model also considers multiple vaccines
  with different levels of efficacy. The distribution of vaccines reduces transmission
  and relative infectiousness of individuals across different age groups. A hypothetical
  case study is solved to illustrate the computational capability of the models. The
  results indicate that priority should be given to the elderly when fatalities are
  minimized. In contrast, the younger population should then be prioritized when the
  objective shifts to suppressing contagion.
