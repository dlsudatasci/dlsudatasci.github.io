# It's Official!

De La Salle University, in partnership with the Megaworld Corporation, has officially launched the establishment of the Dr. Andrew L. Tan Data Science Institute (ALTDSI) last July 21 in a virtual ceremony. The Institute is named after innovator and brand builder, Megaworldâ€™s CEO and Chairman Dr. Andrew L. Tan.

The ALTDSI aims to create new knowledge out of the abundant data available and to train the next generation workforce of data scientists, particularly professionals in the BPO industry. The ALTDSI will capitalize on the state-of-the-art facilities donated by Megaworld Corporation, while DLSU faculty-researchers and visiting professors will sustain ALTDSI research-based graduate programs, undergraduate programs, and training and professional courses.

The ALTDSI will be situated in McKinley Hill Cyberpark in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig.

The event was witnessed by members of the DLSU Board of Trustees, administrators, guests from Megaworld Corporation, and DLSU personalities who had vital roles in sealing the initiative.
