  Computer Assisted Pronunciation Training
  (CAPT) systems aim to provide immediate, individualized
  feedback to the user on the overall quality of the pronunciation
  made. In such systems, one must be able to
  extract features from a waveform and represent words in
  the vocabulary. This paper presents the performance of
  Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Support-Vector Machine
  (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) as automatic
  speech recognizers for the English digits spoken by Filipino
  speakers. Speech waveforms are translated into a
  set of feature vectors using Mel Frequency Cepstrum
  Coefficients (MFCC). The training set consists of speech
  samples recorded by native Filipinos who speak English.
  The HMM-trained model produced a recognition rate of
  95.79% compared to 86.33% and 91.66% recognition rates
  of SVM and MLP, respectively.
