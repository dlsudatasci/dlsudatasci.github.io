  Cognitive functioning in schizophrenia is characterized by a generalized impairment in current cognitive
  ability based on traditional population-based norms. However, these norms assume a normal cognitive
  trajectory and do not directly account for illness-related declines from expected cognitive potential.
  Indeed, schizophrenia patients exhibit even greater deviation between their observed and expected
  cognitive functioning based on expanded norms that leverage premorbid variables resistant to illness-
  related features. The current study further quantified the extent to which illness-related features
  account for this deviation from expectation and assessed its relationship to neurophysiologic (mismatch
  negativity, P3a, theta oscillations), clinical, and psychosocial functioning in schizophrenia patients.
  Expected cognitive ability (PENN-CNB global cognition) in patients (n = 684) was calculated using healthy
  comparison subject (n = 660) weighted regression based on premorbid variables resistant to illness-related
  decline (demographics, single-word reading, parental education). The magnitude of any deviation between
  current (observed) and regression-predicted (expected) cognitive ability was calculated.
  Results indicated that 24% (n = 164) of the total patient population exhibited significant (>= -1.96 SD)
  deviation between observed and expected global cognitive ability. Interestingly, 20% of the total patient
  population (n = 136) had “normal”range cognitive performance when using traditional population-based norms,
  but also had significant deviation from expected cognitive ability. The magnitude of this
  deviation was associated with more severe neurophysiologic abnormalities, longer illness duration,
  higher levels of negative symptoms, and worse psychosocial functioning. Assessment of cognitive deviation
  is thus a complementary metric for characterizing the severity of illness-related cognitive declines in patients,
  while also reflecting the expression and severity of key endophenotypes of schizophrenia.
