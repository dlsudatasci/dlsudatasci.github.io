abstract: Recent resurgence of neural networks in computer vision have resulted in
  tremendous improvements in saliency prediction, eventually, saturating some saliency
  metrics. This leads researchers to devise higher-level concepts in images in order
  to match the key image regions attended to by human observers. In this paper, we
  propose a saliency model which utilizes the top-down attention mechanism through
  the involvement of emotion-inducing region information in the predictorâ€™s feature
  space. The proposed framework is inspired by psychological and neurological studies
  that emotion attracts attention. Using three publicly available datasets with emotion-rich
  images, we were able to show that awareness of the emotion-inducing region improves
  saliency prediction of images. Saliency metrics for probabilistic models, particularly
  information gain and KL divergence, have improved with respect to the same architecture
  without emotion information. Statistical tests show that emotional regions generally
  have higher improvement than neutral regions corroborating psychological studies
  that emotion attracts attention.
