  In this research, we trained nine word embedding
  models on a large corpus containing Philippine Supreme Court
  decisions, resolutions, and opinions from 1901 through 2020. We
  evaluated their performance in terms of accuracy on a
  customized 4,510-question word analogy test set in seven
  syntactic and semantic categories. Word2vec models fared
  better on semantic evaluators while fastText models were more
  impressive on syntactic evaluators. We also compared our word
  vector models to another trained on a large legal corpus from
  other countries.
